# OrCAD_PSpice_1
### OrCAD rel.9.2 - Low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator using discrete components (BJTs). Design, calculations, PSpice performance simulations.
##### Project: Design and simulation a voltage regulator with the following parameters:
Vin = 10 - 15V

Vout = 10Vdc

Pload = 3W

Accuracy = 5%.

Usage:

Clone the repo.

Launch OrCAD Capture CIS.

Load stab_v1.opj project file.

Tip: to see simulations results (directly) select Active Profile from the pull down menu (e.g.: stab2Prot2-DC_Sweep_vI) - click View Simulation Results button. Then in the opened PSpice Probe window: Window - Display Control... - select one predefined display - Restore. The simulation results graphics should show up instantly.

Also there is project_doc/projectDoc_VoltageRegulator_2.pdf (Romanian language).
